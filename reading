CONNECTING OUR APP TO REDUX.

  *** FIRST RUN THE COMMAND npm istall --save react-redux***

  	this makes us to use redux along with our app.
  	NOTE: YOU got an error while installing this, because you put the project name
  	to be "react-redux" and the package you want to install has also the
  	same name. So YOU CHANGED THE PROJECT NAME, then the error is resolved.

1. Inorder to connect our App, first we need to
give our App access to the store, so that it will be able to
use the new states that are returned by the store.

2.To do that wrap the App component inside of the Provider.
	
	ReactDOM.render(
	<Provider store={store}>
		<App/>
	</Provider>,
 	document.getElementById('app')
 );

 3.Import the Provider from react-redux.
 
 4. Now you need to conenct the application (our app with the redux).
 	To do that use the "connect" provided by react-redux.

 	WE can connect our app as
 	 export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);

 	 at the end of our App component.
 	 Since we are using "export default" to export the App,
 	 there's no need to use "curly" braces while importing App in the
 	 index.js file.

 	REFER "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuZ7uZmVyg&index=7&list=PL55RiY5tL51rrC3sh8qLiYHqUV3twEYU_" 

 
 5. You did the process that is explained in the video.

 	and also You connected your Main component to the redux
 	and you dispatched actions directly from the main component in Main.js file

 	First you just defined mapDispatchToProps in Main.js file and just connected that
 	to your Main component, but it gave you an ERROR saying "dispatch is not a function"

 	So it's important to define the mapStateToProps as well, because when you are
 	dispatching the actions, it is changing the state, so we also need to define the
 	mapStateToProps in Main.js. But we don't need to define dispathcing in the App component
 	since we are not using anything related to dispatching there.

 	so you just connected the props to App component.

 PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE
 >When our components are not connected with the Redux, they are
 said to be "DUMB" Components, the components that are connected
 to the Redux are said to be "SMART" components.

 >Change the components that are not connected to redux, in your folder
 you changed the User component, since you connected both the App and
 Main Component. So
 		components
 			--User.js --> Dumb Component
 		containers
 			--App.js    } --these are Smart Components
 			--Main.js	}

 NOTE: WHEN you are not using export default, you need to specify
 curly braces surrounding the component while importing it.

 Here you got an ERROR when you omitted the curly braces for User
 Component

 TO BRANCH IN GIT
 >you gotta branch, when there's master, so for that you need to commit first.
 >and then first
 		git init
		git add .
		git commit -m "msg"
		git branch branchname
		git branch     --->(check whether the branch is creatd or not)
		git checkout branchname
